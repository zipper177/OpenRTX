/**
 * This function allows to obtain the value of a given calibration parameter for
 * frequencies outside the calibration points. It works by searching the two
 * calibration points containing the target frequency and then by linearly
 * interpolating the calibration parameter among these two points.
 * @param freq: target frequency for which a calibration value has to be
 * computed.
 * @param calPoints: pointer to the vector containing the frequencies of the
 * calibration points.
 * @param param: pointer to the vector containing the values for the calibration
 * parameter, it must have the same length of the one containing the frequencies
 * of calibration points.
 * @param elems: number of elements of both the vectors for calibration parameter
 * and frequencies.
 * @return value for the calibration parameter at the given frequency point.
